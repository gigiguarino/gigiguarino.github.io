					My name is Gabrielle Guarino, but mostly everyone calls me Gigi. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Engineering. A list of relevant classes I've taken can be found

					<br><br>
					I'm interested in the combination of math, science, and art. 
					<br><br>
					The way in which I personally combine these 3 things is with video games. I create them through <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/" class="other-link"><strong>Unity</strong></a>'s software, using C#. The pixel art is made through a Mac application called Pixen. 
					<br><br>							
					<strong>My art forms are:</strong>
					<br> 
					knitting, sewing, embroidering, and pixel art.
					<br><br>
					<strong>My programming languages are:</strong>
					<br> 
					C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
