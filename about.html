			My name is Gabrielle Guarino, but mostly everyone calls me Gigi. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Engineering. A list of relevant classes I've taken can be found 
			<a href="#classes">
			<strong>here.</strong></a>
			<br><br>
			At the moment, I am working as a computer repair technician at the university. I repair student and staff computers by running tests on them, ordering new parts, and installing those parts. Also, I volunteer as a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/"><strong>Girls Who Code</strong></a> instructor and teach girls in grades six through twelve different programming languages, depending on their progress. If you're looking for my resume, it can be found

			I'm interested in the combination of math, science, and art. <br><br>
			The way in which I personally combine these three things is with video games. I create them through <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/"><strong>Unity</strong></a>'s software, using C#. The pixel art is made through a Mac application called Pixen.
