			My name is Gabrielle Guarino, but mostly everyone calls me Gigi. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Engineering. A list of relevant classes I've taken can be found 
			<a href="#classes">
			<strong>here.</strong></a>
			<br><br>
			My interests involve both software and hardware engineering, specificially computer architecture. At the moment, I am working as a Computer Repair Technician at the university. I repair student and staff computers by running tests on them, troubleshooting, ordering new parts, and installing those parts. Also, I volunteer as a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/"><strong>Girls Who Code</strong></a> Instructor and teach girls in grades six through twelve different programming languages, depending on their skill level. If you're looking for my resume, it can be found

			I am both an artist and a programmer. My favorite way in which I combine these two things is through the creation of video games. I make them through <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/"><strong>Unity</strong></a>'s software, using C#. The pixel art is made through an application called Pixen.
