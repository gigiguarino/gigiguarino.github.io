				&emsp;My name is Gabrielle Guarino, but mostly everyone calls me Gigi. I am currently a student at the University of Michigan, studying Computer Engineering. A list of relevant classes I've taken can be found 
				<a href="classes" class="other-link invalid">
				<strong>here.</strong></a>
				<br><br>
				&emsp; I'm interested in the combination of math, science, and art. 
				<br><br>
				&emsp;The way in which I personally combine these 3 things is with video games. I create them through <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/" class="other-link"><strong>Unity</strong></a>'s software, using C#. The pixel art is made through a Mac application called Pixen. 
				<br><br>							
				<strong>My art forms are:</strong>
				<br> 
				knitting, sewing, embroidering, and pixel art.
				<br><br>
				<strong>My programming languages are:</strong>
				<br> 
				C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
