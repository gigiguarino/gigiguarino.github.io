						Currently the only browsers I know that work are Safari and Firefox.
						Google Chrome is the only browser I know that absolutely does not work. 
						If you try another browser and it works, or doesn't, let me know so 
						I can update this.

					<h1 class="subtitle">Will be updated soon.</h1>
					<p>
						I haven't tested my games on Windows that often because I do not own a Windows
						machine. I will head to the library sometime in the future and test them. After that, 
						I will update this page. Sorry for the trouble.
