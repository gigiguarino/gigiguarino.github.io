		<h1 class="subtitle">Which browser are you using?</h1>
		<p>
			Currently the only browsers I know that work are Safari and Firefox.
			Google Chrome is the only browser I know that absolutely does not work. 
			If you try another browser and it works, or doesn't, let me know so 
			I can update this.

		<h1 class="subtitle">Will be updated soon.</h1>
		<p>
			I haven't tested my games on Windows that often because I do not own a Windows
			machine. I will head to the library sometime in the future and test them. After that, 
			I will update this page. Sorry for the trouble.
