				&emsp;Each of these games was made with Unity. The code is written in C#, and all of it can be found on my GitHub. All of the graphics for my games have been made in Pixen. 
				<br><br>
				&emsp;Please email me if you have found any glitches, or have any ideas for new games you'd like to see. This is my first time hosting my video games on the web, so I'm still learning!
				<br><br>
				&emsp;<strong> To play the games: </strong>Clicking on the game titles will take you to pages where you can play them. Please be patient, it sometimes take a bit to load, and if it disappears for a bit while loading - that's normal.

					<strong>Flower Fall</strong><br>

					&emsp;This is the first game I've ever made. It was mostly just for me to test out Unity and see what I could do by making something really basic. All of the graphics were made by me.

					<strong>Tic Tac Toe</strong><br>

					<strong>Battle Planet</strong><br>
				</a>
				<p>
					&emsp;This is the game I am the most proud of. I made this game at MHacks 7 with my boyfriend, Jason Grand. We completed the whole thing after working for about 30 hours straight. This game incorporates sounds, and multiple levels. Half of the graphics of this game were made by me, and half were made by Jason.
