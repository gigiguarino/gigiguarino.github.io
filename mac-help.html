					<h1 class="subtitle">Which browser are you using?</h1>
					</p>
						Currently the only browsers I know that work are Safari and Firefox.
						Google Chrome is the only browser I know that absolutely does not work. 
						If you try another browser and it works, or doesn't, let me know so 
						I can update this. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h1 class="subtitle">Screen stays white?</h1>
					</p>
						I have a Mac and sometimes this happens to me. If the box where the game will
						be played stays completely white, and no loading bar ever shows up, hover your
						mouse over the center of the white box. Once your mouse looks like it has hovered
						over something clickable, click there and trust the plug-in. <br>
						Something notable here is that when the loading bar has shown up, and it starts
						actually loading, sometimes the screen will go blank then. Don't do anything when
						this happens. This is actually a good sign, I've come to find out. My computer
						sometimes does this when the game is just about to start. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h1 class="subtitle">Plug-in failure?</h1>
					</p>
						Refresh the page and try again. This usually just happens if you started doing
						something else while it was loading or playing. I am trying to figure out better
						ways to host my games that won't be so touchy. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<h1 class="subtitle">Loading never goes away?</h1>
					</p>
						The fact that the loading bar even showed up is a good sign. I think the best bet for 
						this problem is to just refresh the page and try again. The longest I've ever had to 
						wait is honestly probably only 2 minutes.
